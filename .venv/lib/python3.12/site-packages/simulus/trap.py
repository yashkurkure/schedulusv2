    """A one-time signaling mechanism for inter-process communication.

    Trap is one of the two primitive methods in simulus designed for
    simulation processes to synchronize and communicate with one
    another. (The other primitive method is using semaphores.)

    A trap has three states. It's "unset" when the trap is first
    created and and nothing has happended to it. It's "set" when one
    or more processes are waiting for the trap to be triggered. It
    turns to "sprung" when the trap has been triggered, after which
    there will be no more processes waiting for the trap.

    The life of a trap is described below. A trap starts with the
    "unset" state when it's created. When a process waits for the
    trap, the trap goes to "set", at which state other processes may
    wait on the trap while the trap remains in the same state. When a
    process triggers the trap and if the trap is in the "set" state,
    *all* processes waiting on the trap will be unblocked and resume
    execution (it's guaranteed there is at least one waiting process
    when the trap is in the "set" state). The trap will then
    transition into the "sprung" state. When a process triggers the
    trap which is in the "unset" state, the trap will just transition
    to the "sprung" state (since there are no processes currently
    waiting on the trap). If the trap is "sprung", further waiting on
    trap will be considered as an no-op; that is, the processes will
    not be suspended. A trap must not be triggered more than once.

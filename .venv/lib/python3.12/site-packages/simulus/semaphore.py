class Semaphore(Trappable):
    """A multi-use signaling mechanism for inter-process communication.

    A semaphore is one of the two primitive methods in simulus
    designed for simulation processes to synchronize and communicate
    with one another. (The other primitive method is using traps.)

    A semaphore here implements what is commonly called a "counting
    semaphore." Initially, a semaphore can have a nonnegative integer
    count, which indicates the number of available resources. The
    processes atomically increment the semaphore count when resources
    are added or returned to the pool (using the signal() method) and
    atomically decrement the semaphore count when resources are
    removed (using the wait() method). When the semaphore count is
    zero, it means that there are no available resources. In that
    case, a process trying to decrement the semaphore (to remove a
    resource) will be blocked until more resources are added back to
    the pool. Since semaphores need not be incremented and decremented
    by the same process, they can be used as a signaling mechanism for
    inter-process communication.

    A semaphore is different from a trap. A trap is a one-time
    signaling mechanism. Multiple processes can wait on a trap. Once a
    process triggers the trap, *all* waiting processes will be
    unblocked. A trap cannot be reused: once a trap is sprung,
    subsequent waits will not block the processes and it cannot be
    triggered again. In comparison, a semaphore is a multi-use
    signaling mechanism. Each time a process waits on a semaphore, the
    semaphore value will be decremented. If the value becomes
    negative, the process will be blocked. Each time one signals a
    semaphore, the semaphore value will be incremented. If there are
    blocked processes, *one* of these processes will be unblocked.
    Processes can use the same semaphore repeatedly.

    By default, we use FIFO order (that is, first in first out) to
    unblock processes if multiple processes are waiting on a
    semaphore. Other possible queuing disciplines include LIFO (last
    in first out), SIRO (service in random order), and PRIORITY
    (depending on the priority of the processes; a lower value means
    higher priority). One can choose a queuing discipline when the
    semaphore is created.

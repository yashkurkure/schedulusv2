class Mailbox(object):
    """A mailbox for deliverying messages.

    A mailbox is a facility designed specifically for message passing
    between processes or functions. A mailbox consists of one or more
    compartments or partitions. A sender can send a message to one of
    the partitions of the mailbox (which, by default, is partition 0)
    with a time delay. The message will be delivered to the designated
    mailbox partition at the expected time. Messages arriving at a
    mailbox will be stored in the individual partitions until a
    receiver retrieves them and removes them from the mailbox.

    In Python, the concept of messages (or mails in the sense of a
    mailbox) takes a broader meaning.  Basically, they could be any
    Python objects. And since Python is a dynamically-typed language,
    one can also use objects of different types as messages.

    A mailbox is designed to be used for both process scheduling (in
    process-oriented simulation) and direct-event scheduling (for
    event-driven simulation). In the former, a process can send as
    many messages to a mailbox as it needs to (by repeatedly calling
    the mailbox's send() method). The simulation time does not advance
    since send() does not block. As a matter of fact, one does not
    need to call send() in a process context at all. In this sense, a
    mailbox can be considered as a store with an infinite storage
    capacity.  An important difference, however, is that one can send
    messages to mailboxes and specify a different delay each time.

    One or more processes can call the mailbox's recv() method trying
    to receive the messages arrived at a mailbox partition. If there
    are one or more messages already stored at the mailbox partition,
    the process will retrieve the messages from the partition and
    return them (in a list) without delay. Here, "retrieve" means the
    messages indeed will be removed from the mailbox partition.  In
    doing so, subsequent calls to recv() will no longer find the
    retrieved messages in the mailbox partition. If there are no
    messages currently in the mailbox partition when calling recv(),
    the processes will be suspended pending on the arrival of a new
    message to the designated mailbox partition. Once a message
    arrives, *all* waiting processes at the partition will be
    unblocked and return with the retrieved message.

    There are two ways for the recv() method to retrieve the
    messages. One is to retrieve all messages from the mailbox
    partition; the other is to retrieve only the first one stored in
    the mailbox partition. The user can specify which behavior is
    desirable by setting the 'isall' parameter when calling the recv()
    method.  Regardless of the process trying to receive all messages
    or just one message, if there are multiple processes waiting to
    receive at a mailbox partition, it is possible a process wakes up
    upon a message's arrival and return empty handed (because another
    process may have taken the message from the mailbox). Simulus do
    not dictate, when multiple processes are waiting to receive a
    message, which one will wake up first to retrieve the messages.
    It'd be arbitrary since simulus handles simultaneous events
    without model specified ordering.

    A mailbox can also be used in the direct-event scheduling context
    (event-driven approach). In this case, the user can add one or
    more callback functions to a mailbox partition. A callback
    function can be any user-defined function. Whenever a message is
    delivered to a mailbox partition, *all* callback functions
    attached to the mailbox partition will be invoked.

    Within a callback function, the user has the option to either peek
    at the mailbox or retrieve (or do nothing of the kind, of course).
    One can call the peek() method to just look at the messages
    arrived at a mailbox partition. In this case, a list is returned
    containing all stored messages in the partition. The messages are
    not removed from the mailbox. One can also also call the
    retrieve() method. In this case, the user is given the option to
    retrieve just one of the messages or all messages. Again,
    "retrieve" means to remove the message or messages from the
    mailbox. Like recv(), the user passes in a boolean 'isall'
    argument to indicate which behavior is desirable.
